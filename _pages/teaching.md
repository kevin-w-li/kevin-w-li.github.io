I am TAing [Probabilistic and Unsupervised Learning Approximate Inference and Learning in Probabilistic Models](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/teaching/courses/ml1-2015.html) in the First Term (Autumn/Fall) of 2016. Please refer to the [recommended reading list](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~kevinli/mlcourse/) if you would like to know basic and more advanced materials.  Let me know if you need help!
