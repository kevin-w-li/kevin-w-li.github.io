I am TAing [Probabilistic and Unsupervised Learning Approximate Inference and Learning in Probabilistic Models](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/teaching/courses/ml1-2015.html) in the First Term (Autumn/Fall) of 2016. I have Latexed my solutions to the assignments in my year which I use in the tutorials. These are **not** supposed to be public, but let me know if you need help!
