Ok, maybe not so impressive, but this is my first personal webpage on a public domain. Jekyll is generally nice. I basically downloaded some scripts and ended up figuring why the style sheet does not load on Github Pages. Just a single variable that is misassigned. 

Thanks to my fellow PhD student [Wittawat Jitkrittumu](http://wittawat.com/) who recommended Jekyll to me, which resulted in completion of this site within 24-hours.
