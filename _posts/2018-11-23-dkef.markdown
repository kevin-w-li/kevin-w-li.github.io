In our new [paper](DKEF), we tackle the problem of density estimation using an exponential family distribution with rich structure.
We know that an exponentialy family distribution can be written in the following form.

$$
p(x)\approx \exp(\theta \cdot T(x))q_0(x)
$$

Common distributions (Gaussian, Gamma, etc.) can usually be written in this form. In our work, we take $\theta \cdot T(x) = f(x) = \langle f, k(x,\cdot) \rangle$ where $f$ is a function in the reproducing kernel Hubert space with kernel $k$, 
giving [kernel exponential family](kef).
