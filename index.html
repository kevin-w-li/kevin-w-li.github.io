  <h1 class="page-heading"> Welcome</h1>
  <p>My name is Kevin Li (李文亮, publish as Li K. Wenliang), 
     I am a Research Scientist at Google DeepMind and a Honorary Fellow at University College London at Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging.
     I obtained my PhD at <a href = http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/>Gatsby Computational Neurosicence Unit</a>, University College London, 
     supervised by <a href = http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~maneesh/>Maneesh Sahani </a> and 
     <a href =http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~dayan/>Peter Dayan</a>. 
     I spent my undergraduate at University of Cambridge, supervised by <a href = http://www3.eng.cam.ac.uk/~ml468/>Máté Lengyel</a> for my Master's thesis.<br><br>
     
     My research interest span machine learning and theoretical neuroscience, both are important for me to understanding intelligence. 
     I hope to explore and propose unsupervised and reinforcement learning algorithms, understand the learned representation by agents, and take inpsirations from biological solutions. 
     The ultimate goal is to understand principles of intelligence in artificial and biological agents. <br><br>
